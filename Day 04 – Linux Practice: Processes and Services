🛠️ My Lab Setup:-

To run these commands, I started a fresh Ubuntu environment using Docker:-

docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
apt update && apt install -y systemd htop procps net-tools

1. Process Checks:-

I checked what's running inside my container.

Command: ps aux

Observation: I saw that /bin/bash is PID 1 inside the container. This is different from a real VM where systemd is usually PID 1.

Command: top -n 1

Observation: Captured a snapshot of CPU and Memory. Since it's a fresh container, usage was very low.

2. Service Checks:-

Inside Docker, services behave differently, but I practiced the commands used on production servers.

Command: systemctl list-units --type=service

Observation: Checked which services are available. (Note: In some Docker containers, you might need to use service --status-all if systemd isn't fully initialized).

Command: systemctl status

Observation: Used this to see the overall "health" hierarchy of the system processes.

3. Log Checks:-

Command: tail -n 10 /var/log/alternatives.log

Observation: I checked the last 10 lines of the installation logs to see what packages were recently updated.

Command: ls -l /var/log

Observation: Listed all available log files in the system to know where to look for errors.

4. Mini Troubleshooting Flow: "The Missing Network Tool":-

1.The Problem: I tried to run ifconfig but the command was not found.

2.Investigation: I ran ls /sbin to see if it existed. It didn't.

3.Resolution: I ran apt update && apt install net-tools -y.

4.Verification: Ran ifconfig again, and now it displays my container's internal IP address.
