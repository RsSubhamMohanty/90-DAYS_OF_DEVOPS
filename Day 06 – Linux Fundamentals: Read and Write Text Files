Linux File I/O Practice 📝
🛠️ Lab Environment
OS: Ubuntu (Running via Docker)
Shell: Bash

1. Creating and Writing Files
I practiced the difference between Overwriting (>) and Appending (>>).

Command: touch notes.txt
Action: Created an empty file named notes.txt.
Command: echo "DevOps is about automation and culture." > notes.txt
Action: Wrote the first line. Using > overwrites anything previously in the file.
Command: echo "Linux is the heart of MLOps pipelines." >> notes.txt
Action: Appended a second line. Using >> adds text to the end without deleting existing content.

2. Advanced Writing with tee

Command: echo "Learning Redirection on Day 06" | tee -a notes.txt
Action: This command is powerful because it displays the output in my terminal and writes it to the file at the same time. The -a flag ensures it appends rather than overwrites.

3. Reading and Inspecting Files

Once the file had multiple lines, I practiced reading specific parts of it.
Command: cat notes.txt
Observation: Displayed all 3 lines I wrote earlier.
Command: head -n 2 notes.txt
Observation: Displayed only the first 2 lines. Useful when you want to see the header of a large CSV or log file.
Command: tail -n 1 notes.txt
Observation: Displayed the last line. This is the go-to command for checking the most recent entries in a system log.

         Command                                          Purpose
  touch                                              Create a new empty file.
  >                                                  Redirect output to a file (Overwrites).
  >>                                                 Redirect output to a file (Appends).
  tee -a                                             Show output and append to a file simultaneously.
  cat                                                View entire file content.
  head                                               View the top of the file.


tail                                               View the bottom of the file.
