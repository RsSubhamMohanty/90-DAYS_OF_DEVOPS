Linux Architecture, Processes, and systemd

1. Core Components of Linux ?

The Linux OS is divided into two main "spaces" to ensure stability and security.

Hardware: The physical layer (CPU, RAM, Disk).

Kernel: The "brain." It talks to the hardware and manages resources. It is the bridge between software and hardware.

User Space: Where your applications (Docker, Nginx, Python) and shell run.

Init System (systemd): The very first process (PID 1) that starts after the kernel boots. It manages all other processes.


2. Process Management ?

Every task in Linux is a Process. When you run a command, the system creates a process with a unique PID (Process ID).

Process Lifecycle States

Running (R): The process is currently using the CPU.

Sleeping (S/D): Waiting for an event (like user input) or hardware resource.

Stopped (T): The process has been suspended (e.g., via Ctrl+Z).

Zombie (Z): The process is finished, but its parent hasn't acknowledged it yet. It stays in the process table but uses no RAM.

3. What is systemd?

systemd is the modern system and service manager for Linux. It replaced the old "SysVinit."

Why it matters: It starts services in parallel (faster booting), manages logs via journald, and automatically restarts failed services.

Unit Files: Configuration files (usually ending in .service) that tell Linux how to run a specific app.

top or htop                                            Real-time view of CPU/RAM and running processes.
ps aux                                                 Snapshot of every running process on the system.
kill -9 <PID>                                          Forcefully terminate a stuck process.
systemctl status <service>                             Check if a service (like Docker) is running or failed.
journalctl -u <service> -f                             View live logs for a specific service to debug errors.
