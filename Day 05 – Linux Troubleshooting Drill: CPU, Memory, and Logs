Linux Troubleshooting Runbook 🛠️
Target Service/Process: apt / bash (System Environment)

1. Environment Basics:-

Command: cat /etc/os-release
Observation: Confirmed I am running Ubuntu 22.04.x LTS inside a Docker container.
Command: uname -a
Observation: Shows the Kernel version. Note: In Docker, this shows the Host's kernel version, as containers share the host kernel.

2. Filesystem Sanity:-

Command: mkdir /tmp/runbook-demo && cp /etc/hosts /tmp/runbook-demo/hosts-copy
Command: ls -l /tmp/runbook-demo
Observation: Verified that I have "Write" permissions in the /tmp directory and the file copy was successful.

3. CPU & Memory Snapshot:-

Command: free -h
Observation: Checked available RAM. Since I am in Docker, this reflects the limit allowed by the Docker Desktop/Daemon settings.
Command: ps -o pid,pcpu,pmem,comm
Observation: Viewed specific resource usage. bash is idling at 0.0% CPU, which is expected for an inactive terminal.

4. Disk & IO Snapshot:-

Command: df -h
Observation: Checked overlay filesystem usage. The container has plenty of space available from the Docker virtual disk.
Command: du -sh /var/log
Observation: Log directory size is minimal (under 1MB) because this is a fresh practice container.

5. Network Snapshot:-

Command: netstat -tulpn (or ss -tulpn)
Observation: No active listening ports found yet, as I haven't started a web server (like Nginx) inside this container.
Command: ping -c 3 google.com
Observation: Successful response. Confirmed the container has outbound internet access to download packages.

6. Logs Reviewed:-

Command: tail -n 50 /var/log/dpkg.log
Observation: Traced the history of apt install commands I ran earlier. No installation errors found.
Command: ls -t /var/log | head -n 5
Observation: Identified the 5 most recently updated log files to see where current system activity is being recorded.

🔍 Quick Findings:-
The system is healthy. Resource usage is negligible. The filesystem is writable, and networking is functional. No "Zombie" processes or CPU spikes detected.

🚨 If This Worsens (Next Steps):-
Check Container Stats: From the host machine command prompt, run docker stats to see if the container is hitting its memory limit.
Increase Verbosity: If a command fails, run it with strace (e.g., strace ls) to see the exact system call where it hangs.
Process Restart: If a background process hangs, use kill -15 <PID> (graceful) followed by kill -9 <PID> (force) if it remains unresponsive.
